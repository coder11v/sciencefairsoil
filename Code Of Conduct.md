# **Collaboration Guidelines: PRs & Issues**

To keep our project organized and respectful of everyone’s work, we ask all contributors to follow these guidelines regarding pull requests (PRs) and issue discussions:

---

## **1. PRs**

* **Do not create pull requests unless explicitly assigned or invited.**
* If you think you can help, **please do not submit a PR yet** — first follow the procedure below.

---

## **2. Issue Discussions**

* **Do not comment on issues that are not assigned to you.**
* To contribute, please **create a new issue titled “I want to help”** and briefly describe what you’d like to assist with.
* Maintainers will then assign tasks or provide guidance so your help is coordinated and effective.

---

## **3. Collaboration Spirit**

* We appreciate all contributions and ideas — coordination ensures everyone’s time is respected and work proceeds smoothly.
* Following this workflow prevents confusion, duplicate work, and unreviewed changes.

---

## **4. Enforcement**

* PRs or issue comments submitted without following this process may be closed or removed.
* Repeated violations will be addressed by project maintainers to protect workflow integrity.

**Thank you for helping me collaborate in an organized and positive way!**
